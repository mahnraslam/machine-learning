    Multiple Features


Features names  : Xsubj,  jth feature .
n  : Number  of rows
Feature of  ith  training example : X<sub>2</sub>
for second example
it is represent as second row vector
x^2 = [3,77,1345,9879]

Now model
f = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 +w4x4 + b
f = 0.1X^1 = 4X^2 +10X^3+ -2X^4 + 80
For each sq foot price inc by 0.1 per
for each bedroom price inc by 4 per
for each floor price inc by 10 per
for each year price dec by 2 per

Hence for general 
f = w(vec).x(vec) + b
After dot pro w1x1 + 2x2 + w3x3  + .....wnxn
this is called multiple linear regression or multivariate regression.
